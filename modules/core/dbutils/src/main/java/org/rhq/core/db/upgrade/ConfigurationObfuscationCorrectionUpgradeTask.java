/**
 * We had a buggy version of the password obfuscation code borrowed from JBoss AS.
 * It was susceptible to these two issues:
 * https://issues.jboss.org/browse/SECURITY-344
 * https://issues.jboss.org/browse/SECURITY-563
 *
 * Unfortunately this means an information loss in the encoded value and therefore we have no way of recovering the
 * original passwords. This upgrade task therefore checks if an obfuscated value in a database can be decoded and if not,
 * it clears it out.
